# Crossword-Builder
### Introduction
The aim of this project was to hone my skills with array and matrix manipulation. By building a python program that takes in a list of strings and create a crossword from them.

### Technologies
This program was made in python 3.7, no other packages were used.

### User Guide
This program comes with a testing function that will run multiple cases to demonstrate the output. With some small edits this could be changed to accept user input instead.
